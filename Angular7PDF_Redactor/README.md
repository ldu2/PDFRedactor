## Implementation

### Components
<pre>
App<br/>
|--redactor<br/>
   |--dropzone
</pre>
## Usage
1. You can simply use this tool to redact your PDF file. [Demo](https://ldu2.github.io/PDFRedactor/)<br/>
2. You can use this app as a whole component in your own app to redact pdf file.<br/>
3. You can learn something from the tool,i.e., manipulating PDF file with canvas.<br/>
### Note:
**Once you move on to the next page. The redaction is set on the page.**<br/>
**The larger the resolution of the screen, the better quality of the file maintains.**<br/>
The result is almost the same as the [JS_PDFRedactor](https://github.com/ldu2/PDFRedactor/tree/master/JS_PDFRedactor)<br/>
For the Angular 13 version of pdf file redactor. When upload a file, I am using https://httpbin.org/post as the POST endpoint. No responsibility taken for the safety of the file posted to that end point.<br/>
If you wish you send it to your server, simply clone the repo and modify the code. Simply change the download button to send a POST request.
